# Masters in Data Science portfolio
This repo showcases some of the more creative works produced during my Masters in Data Science postgraduate degree completed between 2019 and 2021.

While each course ran for only six weeks and contained a variety of content and assessments beyond the projects shown, these projects provide some indication of my communication and analytical skills.

## Capstone Project

The capstone project involved working within a group to apply data science techniques to a simulated real-world industry project. We were provided with data relating to short term energy forecasts and limited access to a "client". Based on this fairly broad scope we had to self organise and collaborate remotely as a team to define our research question, undertake the required analysis and produce a written report and video presentation. I was one of the more engaged and experienced team members and played a significant role in keeping the group on track, undertaking technical work (neural network models) and communication (drafting the majority of the report).

## Data Visualisation and Communication

The scope of this project was quite broad. We were tasked with finding data in the public domain and building a series of visualisations to support a video presentation to the "executive". I used Tableau to create visualisations relating to healthy lifestyle choices, including fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol and smoking, based primarily on Australian Census data.

## Data Mining and Machine Learning

This course contained two interesting projects. The first involved understanding customer churn, comparing the three approaches of data mining, "white box" (more interpretable) and "black box" (less interpretable) prediction models. The second project involved designing a neural network architecture to classify persons with Parkinson's Disease based on features extracted from voice samples.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This project involved developing a neutral network language model to predict review sentiment, and produce an accompanying report explaining the analysis. The target accuracy level was relatively ambitious and I one of a handful of students who were able to achieve it.

## Ethics

This fun project involved conducting an ethical review based on the movie The Great Hack which examines potential misuse of data.
